General Mobile 4.5G+ icon is just a meme. So I do not suggest you to install it.\nLTE (Mi A1) option only works on some stock ROMs that have 4.5G logo. It simply changes 4.5G to LTE. It also doesn't work on General Mobile phones.\n4.5G+ logo is (unfortunately) only available on General Mobile option
